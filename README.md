TODO
====
* dialogs should live in a module
  * enter should attempt to submit a dialog, no matter what.
* OMG, kill all caught exceptions from the framework. We should be able to "Pause On Caught Exceptions" in peace
* make sure map.renderString saves/loads properly 
* add last eye-open/eye-closed state to savefile (seperate dict from 'game' data. editor-specific state.)
* show parallax in layers palette.
* allow parallax to be changed via layers palette.
* verify load/save of layer parallax values.
* verify load/save of layer lucency values.
* restore Map palette dimensions like other palettes
* Need a menu item for gathering all windows within the given area, if they are offscreen.
* reorder layers
* tool icons
* edit zones
* entity palette
* VSP selector
* entity selector
* continuous drawing (draw everything in a line from prevLoc to curLoc per frame.  BREZINGHAMZ J0)
* eyeball icons
* eyeball icons for entity layer should hide the "normal" entities
* we should change the entity layer paradigm since they can be ANYWHERE now
* eyeball icon for RENDER layer should do ????
* do we even NEED a render layer?
* all layers should have unique string names and that should be enforced.
* properly initialize infoWindow upon load
* This list is not exhaustive
